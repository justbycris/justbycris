# Hi! I'm Cristi 👋

I'm a Designer and Frontend Developer based in New York City.

I currently work as a Frontend Service Delivery Engineer at Persado, where I help global brands integrate our product to deliver data-driven personalized content that drives conversions. Previously, I was a Designer and Web Developer at a news magazine.

I'm fascinated by effective design systems, large-scale products, and high-impact user experiences. I've worked on projects serving 5M+ users and have contributed to the design and development of A/B tested web and email campaigns for internationally recognized brands—from concept creation through production.

**What I work with:**
- Frontend: React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, AWS, REST API, AMPscript SFMC 
- Design: Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Design Systems
- Focus: Performance, UX/UI, accessibility, and scalable UI architecture

Outside of work, I follow tech trends and their impact on society. I also enjoy photography, gaming, and traveling.
